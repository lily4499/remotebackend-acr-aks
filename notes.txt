Title: Automating Azure Infrastructure and Application Deployment with Terraform, Jenkins, and ArgoCD

Description:
In this YouTube tutorial, we'll guide you through automating the provisioning of Azure infrastructure and 
deployment of applications using Terraform, Jenkins, and ArgoCD. By following this tutorial, 
you'll learn how to set up a seamless CI/CD pipeline stored in GitHub that enhances collaboration, 
mitigates conflicts, and ensures efficient deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) 
using Azure Container Registry (ACR).

Prerequisites:

Azure Account: You'll need an active Azure account to provision resources such as AKS, ACR, and storage.
GitHub Account:  GitHub account to store your project code, Jenkinsfile, and Terraform scripts for version control and collaboration.
Jenkins Setup: Install Jenkins on your preferred platform and configure it to execute pipeline jobs.
Docker Installation: Ensure Docker is installed on your Jenkins server or build agents to facilitate image building.
Kubernetes Knowledge: Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts and configuration.

GitHub Repository:

Tutorial Steps:

- Create a pipeline jenkins job to Setting Up Azure Backend Remote. The Jenkinsfile has for instructions to:  
Create an Azure Storage Account to serve as the backend remote for Terraform state files.
Trigger another pipeline Jenkins job  to initialize the Azure backend and create acr and aks resources.

- Initializing Backend and Develop Terraform scripts to provision Azure resources, including ACR and AKS.:
Configure Terraform to utilize this backend to facilitate collaboration and prevent conflicts.
Utilize parameterized Terraform actions in the Jenkinsfile to allow user choice during resource provisioning, 
enhancing flexibility.
Trigger another pipeline Jenkins job to push image to acr.

- Automating Docker Image Build and Push:

Configure the Jenkinsfile stored in GitHub to automatically build Docker images from your application source code.
Utilize Jenkins pipeline syntax to trigger image pushes to the Azure Container Registry (ACR) upon successful build.
Set up a webhook in your GitHub repository to trigger the Jenkins build job automatically whenever changes are pushed 
to the repository.
Trigger another pipeline Jenkins job to Update Kubernetes Manifests.

- Updating Kubernetes Manifests:
Implement a Jenkins job with a string parameter (Image_Tag) in the Jenkinsfile to update Kubernetes manifests with 
the new Docker image tag.
Ensure seamless deployment of updated manifests to AKS.

- Updating Kubeconfig:
Fetch the kubeconfig file from the AKS cluster in Azure.
Update the local kubeconfig file on your Jenkins server or build agents to establish connectivity with the AKS cluster.

- Installing ArgoCD and Application Deployment:
Utilize the Jenkinsfile stored in GitHub to set up ArgoCD in the AKS cluster for continuous deployment.
Configure ArgoCD to monitor changes in ACR and automatically deploy updated applications to AKS.

- Testing and Verification:
Validate the CI/CD pipeline by triggering builds and deployments through commits to the GitHub repository.
Verify the automated deployment process by observing updates in the AKS cluster through ArgoCD.


Conclusion:
By completing this tutorial, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to automate Azure infrastructure 
provisioning and application deployment using Terraform, Jenkins, and ArgoCD, all managed through a Jenkinsfile 
stored in GitHub. This will empower you to streamline development workflows, enhance collaboration, 
and deploy applications with confidence.
